CARMAGEDDON SPLAT PACK "TIMED" DEMO

The automotive carnage of Carmageddon returns madder and badder 
than ever in the in the Carmageddon series. Interplay and SCI announce 
the release of the first Carmageddon add-on pack, affectionately 
known as the "Splat Pack". 

In the Carmageddon Splat Pack, you return once again 
to spin, slip and slide through pedestrians, cows and 
opponents as you race through an incredible new tracks 
and new environments. Instead of driving through cities and deserts 
you are now able to drive through medieval worlds full of knights in 
shining armor and jesters and even, if you are mad and bad enough, 
visit the fiery gates of Hell in the lava level. 

Making their debuts in the Splat Pack are;
 A huge truck, capable of destoying cars in a single hit 
 a sleek, mean silver Sports Racer, 
 a super charged, hard-as-nails American Classic,
  (Don't worry it comes without the Dukes of Hazard air horn) 
 and for  pure carnage fodder, a Mini!


Minimum Spec
------------
P90
16Mb RAM LOWRES
24Mb RAM 3DFX
70Mb free HD space

The above spec is fairly flexible as you can play around with detail levels
and screen sizing which gives acceptable performance on slower pentiums.

Use the '+' and '-' keys to shrink and enlarge the viewable screen size

INSTALLATION
------------

This demo is compressed with PKZIP 2.04g and requires PKUNZIP 2.04G or a 
compatible program like WINZIP or PKZIP for Windows to install. 

We suggest making a SPLATDEM directory and 
extracting the SPLATDEM.ZIP to this directory
Use the -D option to keep the directory of the data files. 
 PKUNZIP SPLATDEM.ZIP *.* -D

SOUND SETUP
-----------

You must run SNDSETUP.EXE to determine what sound card resides in your
machine before running the game.

RUNNING THE GAME
----------------

Run CARMDEMO.EXE to start playing the demo.  
NOTE:   If the game seems at all 'glitchy' while running in a DOS box under
        Windows 95, then it might be an idea to run it directly from DOS.

Run CARM3DFX.EXE to start playing the 3DFX enhanced version.
                
CONTROLS
--------

The basic default controls are:
Accelerate:                                     Numeric Keypad 8
Brake:                                          Numeric Keypad 2
Turn Left:                                      Numeric Keypad 4
Turn Right:                                     Numeric Keypad 6
Handbrake:                                      SPACE BAR
Repair vehicle:                                 Backspace Key

Use the credits that you've earned to repair your car in mid race!
The damage display in the bottom right hand corner of the screen shows the
current state of your vehicle.  As various components get damaged they will
flash green, then red, and finally turn black.

Recover vehicle:                                Insert Key
When you find yourself lying on your roof with no way of turning over,
for a small price you can be recovered.  Or if you fall off a building that
you wish you hadn't, just recover to a previous safe position.

Gear Down:                                      'Z' key
To achieve doing donuts, hold the 'Gear Down' key (ie 'Z') while in first
gear. Accelerate and start turning!  Keep the 'Gear Down' key pressed as
this disables traction control, and keeps the car in first gear.

Enter/Exit Cockpit:                             'C' key
In external camera mode the cursor keys can be used to pan the camera around
your car, as well as zoom in and out.  Press both the left and right arrows
to center the camera view.

Enter/Exit Action Replay:                       'Enter' key (on keypad)
Action Replay mode is just like having video footage of what you've been up
to so far. The amount of footage that you can replay depends on how much
RAM your machine has.  Once you enter Action Replay mode, you will see a
row of icons at the bottom of the screen.  If you've ever used a VCR before
in this (or any) lifetime, then it should be pretty self explanatory.  
The various rewind/play/fastforward buttons can be activated by either using
the mouse, or with the following keys on the keyboard:

Fast forward:                                           Numeric Keypad 6
Frame advance:                                          Numeric Keypad 3
Play/pause:                                             Numeric Keypad 5
Frame advance backwards:                                Numeric Keypad 1
Rewind:                                                 Numeric Keypad 4
Switch between playing forwards and backwards:          Numeric Keypad 0
Go to very beginning of footage:                        Numeric Keypad 7
Go to the very end of the footage:                      Numeric Keypad 9
Change camera:                                          Numeric Keypad *(star)
* Standard camera:   normal game view.
* Panning camera:    stationary camera points.  TV coverage style.
* Action camera:     gives gruesome closeups of all your best moments.


The red and green bar above the row of icons shows you what point you are at
through the footage. 

Tip:    To get the best performance out of your PC, shut down Windows 95
        and get yourself to a DOS prompt. Run the game from there - you 
        will now have some memory to play with in Action Replay.  (This is
        especially true if you are running Windows 95 on a 16Meg machine)


You can reconfigure the controls by selecting 'Options' from the Main Menu,
and then choosing 'Controls'.  Note that if you have installed the demo to
your hard disk then any changes you make to the controls are permanent, i.e.
if you quit out of the game, and then run it again, you will still have the
changes that you made.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you are having trouble with the rendered intro then it might be an idea to
remove the file MIX_INTR.SMK which can be found in the directory:
 \DATA\CUTSCENE, 
as this feature has not yet been fully tested.

If you have a 8meg machine and are having problems with a lack of memory
check to see how much expanded memory you have free. You will need at
least 7.5 meg free. If you do not have this amount free then we recommend
you remove the EMM386 line from your config.sys file. Also check to see if
you are loading smartdrive. This must also be removed.

If you insist on running Carmageddon in Windows95 on a 8 meg machine then
you will need to create a shortcut on your desktop and edit the memory 
properties and change the DPMI setting from auto to 8190. If you do not
do this then Win95 will start to use Virtual Memory and sloooooow every
thing down.

And as a last resort if at the command prompt you type carmdemo -nosound
then this will disable all sound within the game and greatly increase
your chances of seeing the game run.

If you have an ESS Audiodrive the sound setup will not auto detect it.
You must manually select an ESS Audiodrive from the soundcard list
