# OpenC1

OpenC1 is a ground-up remake of the classic driving and wrecking game by Stainless Software.

[Project page](http://1amstudios.com/projects/openc1)

#### Important Notes
 * Ported from XNA 3.0 to MonoGame (DesktopGL)
 * **Running in custom MonoGame build (to fake XNA 3.0 for the Nvidia PhysX .NET Wrapper)**
 * **The content from the content folder needs to be built with the custom build Pipeline tool first before debugging otherwise it will throw an exception! Just run the `run_content_pipeline.bat`. You can find the Pipeline tool in `` OpenC1_MonoGame\MonoGame-develop\Tools\Pipeline\bin\Windows\AnyCPU\Debug ``**

 #### Known Issues
* BasiscEffect2.fx is currently broken and needs to be ported to MonoGame as well!
* Cannot get in-game (where the 3D stuff happens)😕
  * The parsers seem to misbehave ... not sure ... 🧐
